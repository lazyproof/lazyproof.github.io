What if there was a component that could solve problems?

It would register problems, prioritize them, and solve them.

What are the subcomponents of this?

- Understanding the problem, knowledge representation, comprehension
- Prioritize problems based on Goals
- Achieve problems one-by-one, the problem solver. Read the possible actions and choice best decision.
- An operating system would be responsible to sense the environment and present a representation of all available actions for each moment.

I seek to focus on the problem solving kernel of this entire system. How a piece of software, given a problem, would go about solving it.

What would a problem even look like?

I'm hungry.
I'm sad.
I'm lonely.

What am I trying to optimize? I'm trying to survive. Trying to live. Trying to succeed.

Build a business.
Make money.
Build value.
Find a suitable long-term partner.

What are the hardest problems that huamns have to solve today?

IF you could haave some entity that was much more intelligent than you, what would it be able to do?

- It can understand the entireity of existing knowledg that exists in the world today from the internet.
- It could see everything, hear everything, record everything

- Facts
- Judgements
- Statements

It makes decisions to solve a problem.
It is the controller of actions of the unit.
It decides what's good or bad.

At their core, it is a decision making system.
